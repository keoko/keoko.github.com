<p>
My name is Natxo and I've been working on web development since 2000. My main areas of interest are scripting languages (PHP, Ruby, Python, etc.), web frameworks (Django, rails, etc.), web architectures, web standards (HTTP, XHTML, XML, etc.), web services (REST, SOAP, WS-*) and lately I've been playing with functional programming, especially erlang.
