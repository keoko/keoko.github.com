Bored with my ISP connection issues, finally I've moved my blog to <a href="http://www.slicehost.com/">Slicehost</a> and got really surprised with the fast installation. Just one minute after the registration process I was accessing to my new baked Ubuntu virtual machine. One hour after, I had my blog migrated to Slicehost. Impressive!
